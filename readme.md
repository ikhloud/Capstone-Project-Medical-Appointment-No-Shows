### Project Motivation

This project is the capestone for the Data Scientist Nandegree Program from Udacity. I choose to work on a data set that contains Medical Appointment No Shows. This dataset collects information from 100k medical appointments in Brazil and is focused on the question of whether or not patients show up for their appointment . We will analyse the Dataset to find what factors are important for us to know in order to predict if a patient will show up for their scheduled appointment?

### Dataset Description:

The original dataset can be downloaded from Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/joniarroba/noshowappointments#KaggleV2-May-2016.csv

110.527 medical appointments its 14 associated variables (characteristics). The most important one if the patient show-up or no-show to the appointment. 

The data is contained on 14 variable. 

Here is the explanation of each variable :

- 01 - PatientId - Identification of a patient
- 02 - AppointmentID - Identification of each appointment
- 03 - Gender - Male or Female
- 04 - AppointmentDay - The day of the actuall appointment, when they have to visit the doctor.
- 05 - ScheduledDay - The day someone called or registered the appointment, this is before appointment Day.
- 06 - Age - How old is the patient.

- 08 - Scholarship - indicates whether or not the patient is enrolled in Brasilian welfare program Bolsa Família.

- 13 -SMS_received - 1 if messages sent to the patient else 0.
- 14 - No-show - Be careful about the encoding of "No-show": it says 
**No** if the patient showed up to their appointment,**Yes** if they did not show up.
